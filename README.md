# PyPoll with Python

## Overview of Project
For this week's project, we are using Python to generate an election vote count report. Python is a very powerful and popular programming language that we will use to read, write, process, and manipulate data. There are several ways that we can write and execute Python scripts such as through the Python interpreter or using a text editor. For this project, the text editor we will be using is Visual Studio Code.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to assist a Colorado Board of Election employee, Tom. Tom is asking us to tabulate election results and create a report for a U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. There are three primary voting methods in this data set that we're considering: mail in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic. Not only can this code be used for this specific scenario, but we're hoping it will be utilized for other congressional districts, senatorial districts, and location elections. Using this data, we will report number of total votes, each county's number of votes and percentage of total votes, the county with the largest number of votes, each candidate's number of votes and percentage of total votes, and the winning candidate with their vote count and percentage of total votes.
